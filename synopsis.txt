Good afternoon everyone! Today, we are presenting a project aimed at preventing unfortunate incidents involving elephants and railway collisions in North Bengal and this incidents keep on increasing day by day. Elephants often roam near railway tracks, and with no warning system in place, they are sometimes tragically struck by trains.
Our solution uses two ultrasonic sensors and six piezo sensors to detect the presence and stress levels of elephants approaching the railway tracks. The system starts with yellow and green LEDs to indicate normal conditions. When the ultrasonic sensors detect an object within 20 cm, it signals a potential danger, changing the LED colors to yellow and red, alerting that an elephant is nearby.
If the piezo sensors, placed strategically to detect stress levels in the ground, sense any high pressure from the elephant's movements, the system further raises the alarm by switching the LEDs to red and activating a servo motor. This servo motor could be used to trigger another alert mechanism, such as notifying authorities or activating barriers.
In this way, we hope to provide a safety net for elephants and prevent deadly accidents while also helping railway operations run smoothly without disruption. Though itâ€™s not the ultimate solution which can be implemented directly onto that northern part but we created  the basic prototype and general idea by considering the diversity of power issues
Further this project can also be remodified using some various IoT device and with the help of cloud computing we can transfer this news to the server room of the Northern Railway to notify the driver at very early stage of piloting the car"
